[hosts]
! Line starts with ! in this segement will be treated as comment, no inline comment support
! Compatible with traditional hosts grammar
! You can use wildcard '*' and '?' in domain name
! '*' will match any content in domain name, '?' will match content in only one level of domain
! e.g. *.google.com will match www.google.com and www.l.google.com
! e.g. ?.google.com will only match www.google.com, www.l.google.com won't be matched
! Domain name starts and ends with '/' will be treated as regular expression rule
! A regular expression rule will be sent to regular expression engine to perform match directly
! Rules starts with dns name which declared in [DNS Config] section will be resolved by specific server only
! Each rule has it's own priority, from 1 to 5, 1 is the highest priority and 5 is the lowest
! The traditional hosts rule -- IP<tabs or spaces>domain -- will be treated as priority level 2 (mid-high)
! Regular expression rule, or any rule which domain name contains '*' or '?' will be treated as priority level 3 (mid)
! Rule which specific the dns server will be treated as priority level 4 (mid-low)
! Priority level 1 and 5 will not be apply to rule implicitly
! You can assign the priority explicitly by adding '<[1-5]> ' to the head of each rule
